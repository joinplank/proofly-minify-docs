description: "Verify nursing licenses on the Nursys website by name across all license types"
api: "POST /api/nursys/license-verification/by-name-all-license-types"
---

Search for nursing licenses by name and state across all supported license types. This endpoint enqueues one job per license type and returns a parent job ID that can be used to track aggregated results. This is useful when you want to find all licenses held by a particular nurse in a state, regardless of license type.

<Endpoint method="POST" url="/api/nursys/license-verification/by-name-all-license-types" />

<ParamField body="lastName" type="string" required>
  The last name of the nurse to search for.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="firstName" type="string" required>
  The first name of the nurse to search for.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="state" type="string" required>
  The state where the license is issued. Can be a full state name (e.g., "California") or abbreviation (e.g., "CA"). The API will normalize the state name automatically.
</ParamField>

</CodeGroup>

## Response

This endpoint processes requests asynchronously and returns a parent job ID for tracking aggregated results across all license types.

### 202 Accepted

```json
{
  "jobId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

### Job Result (when completed)

When the job status is `completed`, the `resultData` contains aggregated individuals from all license type searches:

```json
{
  "individuals": [
    {
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "firstName": "Jane",
      "licenseType": "RN",
      "state": "California",
      "licenseNumber": "12345678"
    },
    {
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "firstName": "Jane",
      "licenseType": "APRN-CNP",
      "state": "California",
      "licenseNumber": "87654321"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `individuals` array may contain multiple license records for the same person if they hold different license types in the same state.

## Notes

- This endpoint processes requests asynchronously and returns job IDs
- This endpoint searches across all license types, which may take longer than specific searches
- Poll the [Jobs endpoint](/api-reference/jobs) to check status and retrieve results
- State names are automatically normalized (e.g., "CA" becomes "California")
- The Nursys website may require CAPTCHA solving, which is handled automatically
- Search results depend on the data available in the Nursys database
- Empty `individuals` arrays indicate no matching licenses were found across any license type

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When to Use This Endpoint">
    Use this endpoint when you don't know the specific license type or want to find all licenses. For faster results when you know the license type, use the specific endpoints instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Performance Considerations">
    Since this endpoint searches across all license types, it will take longer and use more resources than searching for a specific license type.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Handling Results">
    The results may contain multiple entries for the same person if they hold different license types. Filter or group results by license number or name as needed.
